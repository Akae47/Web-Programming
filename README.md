**Feedback form**

**Problem Definition 1**

Prospective students often visit the campus to take a look around, evaluate the facilities, and get a
sense of how they feel about the university. After their visit, the university would like to gather 
feedback. In this project, I will create a professional-looking HTML document that allows prospective 
students to provide feedback about their campus visit.

This  document should display a form containing:

• text boxes for the student’s name, street address, and e-mail address.

• checkboxes that allow prospective students to indicate what they liked most about the campus. The
checkboxes should include: students, location, campus, courses offered, housing, and sports.

• radio buttons that ask the prospective students how they became interested in the university. Options
should include: family, friends, television, Internet, and other.

• a pulldown menu with multiple choices showing the departments they visited.

• a text area for additional comments, a submit button, and a reset button.
